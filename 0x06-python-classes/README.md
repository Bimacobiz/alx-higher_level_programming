4-square.py - a class square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)
5-square.py - a class square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)
6-square.py - a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)
100-singly_linked_list.py - a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by:Private instance attribute: data:
Private instance attribute: next_node: Instantiation with data and next_node: 
101-square.py - Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 6-square.py), Private instance attribute: size:
