0x04-python-more_data_structures

This directory has exercises and functions telated to Python's more advanced data structures. 
it  illustrates the application of Python in solving problems. The concepts are built upon 
foundational data structures that are covered in the previous topics and they dive deeper in 
capabilities of python. it contains various files that include:
