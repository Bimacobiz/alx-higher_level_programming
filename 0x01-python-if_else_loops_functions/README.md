This directory contains functions related to if/else, loops, functions. It contains various files namely:
0-positive_or_negative.py - a program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.It involves completing a source code provides to ensure that it prints whether the number contained in a variable number is positive or negative.
1-last_digit.py - a program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.it involves completign source code to ensure that it prints the last number that has been stored in the variable number.2-print_alphabet.py - a program that will print the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3-print_alphabt.py - a program that will prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4-print_hexa.py - a program that will print all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal. 
5-print_comb2.py - a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
6-print_comb3.py - a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7-islower.py - that checks for lowercase character.
8-uppercase.py - prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9-print_last_digit.py - prints the last digit of a number.
10-add.py - adds two integers and returns the result.

12-fizzbuzz.py - prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
13-insert_number.c, lists.h - c programming sourcefiles associated with the program
100-print_tebahpla.py - prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
101-remove_char_at.py - creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
102-magic_calculation.py - the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the example provided
