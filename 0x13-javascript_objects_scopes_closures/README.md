## 1. Objects

### Object Basics

Objects are a fundamental data type in JavaScript, providing a way to group related data and functionality together. Learn how to create and manipulate objects to enhance your code structure.

### Object Properties

Dive into the world of object properties, exploring how to add, modify, and delete properties dynamically. Understand property attributes and their impact on object behavior.

### Object Methods

Discover how to define methods within objects, allowing you to encapsulate functionality. Learn the difference between regular functions and methods and how to invoke them.

### Object Prototypes

Explore the concept of prototypes in JavaScript and how they contribute to object inheritance. Understand the prototype chain and how it influences object behavior.

## 2. Scopes

### Global Scope

Understand the global scope in JavaScript and how variables declared in this scope are accessible throughout the entire program.

### Local Scope

Learn about local scopes and how they enable encapsulation of variables within specific functions or blocks. Understand the concept of variable shadowing.

### Lexical Scoping

Explore the powerful concept of lexical scoping, where the scope of a variable is determined by its location within the source code.

## 3. Closures

### Understanding Closures

Delve into the concept of closures, a powerful feature in JavaScript. Learn how closures allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing scope even after that scope has finished execution.

### Use Cases for Closures

Discover practical use cases for closures, such as maintaining state in functions, implementing private variables, and creating factory functions.

### Closure Pitfalls

Be aware of common pitfalls associated with closures, including memory leaks and unexpected variable behavior. Learn best practices for avoiding these issues.
