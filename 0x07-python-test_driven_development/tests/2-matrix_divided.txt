Usage of 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================

''matrix_divided(matrix, div)'' is a matrix division function defined in this module.
Usage
=====

``The function ''matrix_divided(...)'' creates a new matrix that is a copy of the parameter
 ''matrix'' with all entries divided by ''div''.


::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [3, 6, 9],
    ...     [12, 15, 18]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

The maximum number of decimal places for quotients is two.
::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

The initial matrix remains the same.

::

    >>> print(matrix)
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Floating-point numbers can also be handled by the function.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1.1, -2.2, 3.3],
    ...     [4.4, 5.5, -6.6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.37, -0.73, 1.1], [1.47, 1.83, -2.2]]

You can combine floating and integers.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, -2.2, 3, 4.4, 5],
    ...     [-6.6, 7.00, 8, 9.999, 10]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, -0.73, 1.0, 1.47, 1.67], [-2.2, 2.33, 2.67, 3.33, 3.33]]

Invalid Matrices
==============

''matrix'' argument must be a list of lists with either ints or
floats. A TypeError is thrown if ''matrix'' is not a list.

::

    >>> matrix = "not a list"
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError:  Matrix must be a matrix (set of lists) of integers or floats; 

::

    >>> matrix = None
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Matrix must be a matrix (set of lists) of integers or floats; 

The TypeError will be raised if the list is empty.

::

    >>> matrix = []
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

But a list of empty lists will prevail..

::

    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[]]

If ''matrix'' is not specifically a list of lists, an equivalent TypeError is raised.


::

    >>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

In the case where any elements in the matrix are neither ints nor floats
the same type error will be raised.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, "not a number", 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


Finally, all the rows in ``matrix`` must be the same size. If any rows are
of different sizes, a new TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3, 4],
    ...     [5, 6, 7]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix should be of the same size

Invalid Divisors
================

The ``div`` parameter has to be either a float or an int. Otherwise the function
will raise a typeerror.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "not a number"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div has to be a number

::

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, None))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: dive has to be a number

``div`` has to be a non-zero. Otherwise, the function will raise ZeroDivisionError.

::

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
